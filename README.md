# Turtle Star Art

This Python program uses the Turtle graphics library to draw a central star with five smaller stars around it. It's a fun and creative way to create star-shaped art!

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the `turtle_star.py` file.

2. Open your terminal or command prompt.

3. Navigate to the directory where `turtle_star.py` is located.

4. Run the program by executing the following command:

   ```bash
   python turtle_star.py
   ```

5. You will see a Turtle graphics window displaying the central star and surrounding stars.

## Customization

You can customize the appearance of the stars by modifying the program. Here are some things you can change:

- **Star Sizes:** Adjust the `central_star_size` and `surrounding_star_size` variables to change the size of the stars.

  ```python
  central_star_size = 100  # Size of the central star
  surrounding_star_size = 30  # Size of the surrounding stars
  ```

- **Star Colors:** You can change the colors of the stars by modifying the `pen.color()` statements.

  ```python
  pen.color("red")  # Color of the central star
  pen.color("blue")  # Color of the surrounding stars
  ```
